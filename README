This is a set of code I wrote just for fun. These codes are hereby made available under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 or (at your option) a higher version of the GNU GPL.

The codes are made available in the hope that they may be useful to fellow hackers like me, who are students, and would like to play with some code "Just for fun".
