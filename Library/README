This is a program that I wrote in 2008. The program is to manage a library (of books).

This is free software, hereby made available under the terms of the GNU GPL v3, or
(at your option) any higher version of the GNU GPL.

Unfortunately, the graphics routines used in this program are available only for Windows.
In case you know of a similar library to use in Linux or any other *nix systems, please feel
free to submit a patch. I believe that ncurses could be used, but I'm in no mood to modify
this program any further.

Some changes are being made from the original version in 2008. The newer version uses
autoconf to compile and uses the MinGW compiler to compile. We have moved away from the original
Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.
UPDATE: The system can also be compiled using CMake
