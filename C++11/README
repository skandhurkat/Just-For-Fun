This is a set of codes used to test functionality in C++11.
The codes have been written to be as cross-platform as possible, and
can be compiled using CMake.
I have tested the codes on GCC 4.6 and 4.7, and on Visual Studio 2012.
The codes do not work, yet, on MinGW systems because threads are not yet
supported in MinGW (though I believe that some patches are available
for MinGW32)

- microcounter is a simple counter benchmark used to test threads
- pnqueens is a parallel implementation of the n queens problem
